            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>HOW Sin is ſtrengthened, And how it is OVERCOME.</head>
            <p>THat ſin is in the world, and that all are thereby become children of wrath, is generally believed and confeſſed by all; but how ſin is ſtrengthened in men and women againſt God and their own ſouls, or how it is overcome, few there be that have learned or mind to know; yet for their ſakes that doth, I do here declare ſomewhat of that which I have received from him, who is faithful and true in all his teſtimony.</p>
            <p>And this I find that as ſin got rooting at firſt through luſt, ſo till this day it hath its ſtrength, by the deſires going forth to affect or luſt after ſomething, whether ſpiritual, or carnal, above, before or beſides what that eternal Spirit by which man was created, doth communicate to him, or beget in him; for the eye of the Lilly being blinded by the god of this world which eye ſhould look un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God for all; there is an eye of unbelief open, which looks into the viſibles, and gives occaſion for the luſt to conceive in the mind, affections and deſires, after ſomething which the Spirit of God leads not to, for the obtaining whereof all the power and wiſdom that is in man is ſet on work, and this becomes ſin both in the deſires and actions, and the more it is followed, the ſtronger it is; for whatever is hereby obtained, becomes a treaſure of wickedneſs, laid up in the Habitation of the Wicked one, whereby the luſt is increaſed, and the Seed of God burthened and buried, whereby the Creature becomes daily more unſenſible of the Will of God, and the movings of that pure Spirit which ſhould keep the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:59822:2"/>Creature alive to the Creator, and drew the mind wholly up to the Father, on him alone to wait for a ſupply in all things, both for ſoul and body: And every deſire that ſprings from this root being ſuffered to go forth, defiles the man, and brings in that which oppreſſeth the Juſt, until by continuance man grows into the nature of the enmity, and the imaginations of the heart be wholly evil, and that which ſhould give the knowledge of God wholly buried, and in many that which ſhould give the knowledge of ſin alſo, whereby man becomes paſt feeling, utterly dead in ſins and treſpaſſes heaped upon the juſt againſt the day of Judgment, which becomes by cuſtom as natural to commit, as to the <hi>Ox</hi> to drink water; yea with greedineſs doth man in this condition hunt after his own deſtruction, having dawn'd up the way of Life in himſelf by often tranſgreſſing it, and is become degenerate from the nature of God, having received in, and willingly joyned to that nature of Satan, which as a leaven hath and doth work into its own nature all that receive it, or yield unto it, whom as they grow therein, there ſprings up fruits of the ſame root and nature, which they bring forth in his time and opportunity, with liking and delight, being furniſhed with all ſubtilty, to colour them over, and plead for them, being in Covenant and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with ſin, ſome in one thing, and ſome in another, every one pleading the allowance of that ſin with God which moſt ſuits their luſts, pride, profit or pleaſure, credit or eſteem in the World, or ſome ſelf-end, and at theſe they take counſel, and not at the Spirit of the Lord; what is ſin, and what is no ſin, but none will believe that they can be ſet free from all ſin by him who teſtifies againſt all ſin in ſpirit; and in all this the Man of ſin hath his Kingdom by conſent for they being willing to keep Covenant with him in one evil, are guilty of all.</p>
            <p>Now the way to overcome all this, and him that hath his power therein, is by Faith in Chriſt Jeſus the Light, and Life, and Way to the Father; for without believing there can be no victory; but in the faithfull following of him, and patient bearing his Croſs, and enduring his ſufferings, comes the enmity to be ſlain, and captivity led captive, and man ſet at liberty in the holy Seed, to ſerve the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Spirit and Life again.</p>
            <p>And firſt, Chriſt as he is the Light of the World muſt be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:59822:2"/>for ſo he comes to manifeſt and reprove the deeds of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and to make a ſeparation between the works of God, and the works of the Devil in the mind and ſpirit of the Creature, and to let them ſee what ſpirit doth exerciſe their minds and affections, and the fruits of each ſpirit. and the moving and working of each ſpirit ſeverally, without which none can rightly know what is to be deſtroyed, and what ſaved: what to joyn to, and what to war againſt: for by this Light alone comes man to the knowledge of ſin in himſelf, in the ground and root of it, and every motion thereof: for though the Letter, or ſomething without, may ſhew what is ſin by its fruits when it is brought forth, yet it is the work of the Spirit to diſcover ſpiritual wickedneſs in its firſt motion, which is the only place to kill it ere it become ſin; and this Light muſt be believed, and diligently minded all along; for ſuch is the ſubtilty of the Enemy, having got power over the will and ſenſes of man, that he will ſet them to war againſt the Creature, and deſtroy the Creation rather then that of his which defiles the Creature, and this cannot be avoided any other way but by mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Light of Chriſt, to ſeparate that which is but to be cleanſed, from that which is to be deſtroyed, and this man cannot do without the Spirit, being a ſpiritual work, though he never ſo much ſeeks after it: And here is the cauſe why many are kept at hard labour all their time, and never come clear out of ſin and uncleanneſs, even not believing in that which hath the power to ſeparate and lead out of the evil, but without the ſingle eye are at work in the dark, and ſees not a clear ſeparation in the body: And hence it is that ſome deſtroy themſelves in ſeeking to deſtroy ſin, not mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Light of the Saviour, is led by the Deſtroyer, fighting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that which Chriſt comes to ſave; whilſt he that comes to deſtroy lies hid in the dark: But he that believes in that which manifeſts all things, reproves all things, and judges all things, with that Eye ſhall be led what to war againſt, and what to joyn with all along in the work, for he alone is the Covenant of Light, and given for a Leader, which whoſoever believes and follows ſhall not err in judgment or practice, but unbelief therein is the cauſe why there are ſo many blind Guides, and many people dye in their ſins.</p>
            <p>And thus he is the Way of God, and is to be believed in (to wit)
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:59822:3"/>as he manifeſts the works of the Devil apart from the work of God, condemning the one in the fleſh, and juſtifying the other in the Spirit: and as he manifeſts every ſpirit with its workings, motions, and ends, their ground and off-ſpring, whence they co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e, and whither they return, that thereby the Creature may know who it is that exerciſes his mind and members, and to what ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit he yeilds himſelf in his obedience and ſervice, and ſo may come to know the uſe and end of all his works, what to chuſe, and what to refuſe; what to juſtifie, and what to condemn in its firſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, before it be brought forth or formed in the womb, that judgment may be kept on the head of tranſgreſſion, and liberty proclaimed to the juſt. And for want of faith and feeling of this Way of Chriſt it is that ſo many periſh in ſin, and yet ſeem to ſtrive againſt ſin, even becauſe they cannot believe that to be ſufficient to ſave from ſin which manifeſts ſin in the ground, and condemns it in its firſt motion, which if they did but in faith joyn with him to condemn ſin in the ground, temptation, and motion, it would die and wither, and not be able long to live or prevail: and if it for a time ſhould prevail in the members, yet not to comdemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for I have found a great difference between ſin condemned in the Creature (though not yet wholly dead) and ſin lived in, and pleaded for; for if thy life and judgment be in that alone which condemns ſin, then art thou dead to ſin and alive to Chriſt, and it is no more thou that ſins, but ſin that yet remains in thee, to which thou art dead, to which thou doſt not conſent, like, nor approve of, nor any way add any ſtrength thereto; but thy faith and love, delight and ſtrength is in him, which condemns it: he that truly is in this faith and love, by the working thereof ſhall all his Enemies periſh, and by that Faith and Love ſhall the juſt live in that Creature, and he in him condemning and killing ſin till it all be done away, and the Creature of God found alive in him alone, who without ſpot will preſent him to the Father: for this I have found, that that which manifeſts ſin in its firſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, judges it there, and condemns it there, hath the only power to kill ſin ere it be committed, and ſo hath only power to ſave from condemnation; for this you ſhall find, that as Chriſt doth not live to Juſtification, where he is not believed and juſtified, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, followed, and confeſſed, ſo ſin doth not live to condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:59822:3"/>where it is hated, condemned, and denyed; for where that ſpirit of wickedneſs is ſeen in the light, and ſeparated from, and judged apart from the creature, the creature joyning in judgment with the juſt, there ſin will wither, and <hi>Satan</hi> flee, for there he hath no kingdom, nor a hiding <hi>Habitation;</hi> for the light being minded, and judgment having free paſſage and conſent, it ſearcheth out his hidden things, and judgment paſſeth upon all his deceit, root and ground, with his fruits; ſo is the ſtrong man ſpoiled, and his ſtuff by faith in Chriſt, and not by ſtrength of the creature, by believing the juſt and denying the unjuſt.</p>
            <p>For according to every mans <hi>faith,</hi> ſo ſhall he receive from God: now he that believes ſalvation, and that cleaves to, and lives in ſome ſin, and pleads for it, and believes he muſt do ſo, his faith ſtands in an unclean thing, and an unclean thing will live by that <hi>faith,</hi> and be juſtified by that <hi>creature;</hi> and in his juſtifying any thing that is unclean, therein is the juſt condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and the juſt being condemned which ſhould give dominion over the <hi>unlean,</hi> the wild <hi>Plant</hi> hath it<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> liberty to grow until it overſpread the <hi>Plant</hi> of God, and cover the man, wholly ſtop the ear, and blind the eye, and hardens the heart againſt every motion to good, or check for evil: and let not this man look for good, fruit but after his <hi>faith</hi> who ſo believes.</p>
            <p>Alſo, on the contrary, <hi>He that feels a ſtrife in himſelf between the clean and the unclean, and ſeas the one reprove for ſin, and the other plead for ſin, and believes in that which is pure, clean and juſt, which condemns the unjuſt and unclean, that faith ſtands in that which is pure, and the myſtery of it is held in a pure conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; and that pure faith being followed, will purifie the heart, and cleanſe the hands from unjuſt actions; and by that faith the juſt lives, and grows and ſprings, and brings forth, and the pure Plant ſpreads and covers the Earth with the Knowledge of God, his holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and purity, and all grace in the heart, which becomes as a working leaven, till it hath a wrought out the unclean nature and conformed the whole man to himſelf: and this is a work of the holy Faith, which none can receive but who believes in holineſs; for none can bring clean fruit out of an unclean Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this further, for the incouragement of ſuch as honeſtly indeed would be rid of their ſin, and ſet free to ſerve God in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:59822:4"/>will preſent him before thee; and this made the Saints of old indure the Croſs, and deſpiſe the ſhame, and bear the reproach after him joy fully, following the Lamb in all his leadings.</p>
            <p>So thou that loveſt holineſs, it is near thee; power over ſin and Satan is near thee: Salvation is at hand; go not forth to ſeek that abroad which thou haſt loſt in thy own Houſe; he is thy ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that condemn ſin in thy boſom; he that reproves the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed is with thee: he that is pure is thy peace: he that never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to ſin, but ſtands a witneſs againſt it, if thou have ſuch a ſpirit in thee, thou haſt the Spirit of Chriſt the Saviour: So take heed unto him, to believe him, and to mind his leading, and to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him, if thou part not from him he will be thy everlaſting peace, and over-ruling power to ſubdue thy ſins; and by him ſhalt thou tread down ſtrength with eaſe and delight, and ſhalt be able to ſay with ſuch as was come to the ſame ſpirit, <hi>Greater is he that is in thee, then he that is in the World;</hi> and only that Faith that ſees him hath power to overcome the World, for he that beholds his glory, treads the Worlds glory under his feet; for whatſoever is ſeen in him doth ſo far exceed all other things, that it takes the mind out of all other delight, and leaves them empty; ſo that things in <hi>Heaven,</hi> and things in <hi>Earth,</hi> Principalities nor Powers are able to ſeparate from the love of him, how much more wilt thou leave thy delight in ſin, when thou comeſt to delight in him! his love will conſtrain thee, who loves purity, and hath found it, for this is joy indeed, and love unſpeakable, when the ſoul finds that treaſure in his own Houſe freely given, which he hath long been ſeeking abroad, and could never purchaſe neither with life nor eſtate: And the more thou beholdeſt him, the more will his Glory and Love appear, for as thou in the Light beholdeſt the pure motions of the Holy One, thou wilt come to ſee what thou art without him, and what thy wants is, without which thou canſt not be happy, and that thou canſt not have a laſting peace till with his vertue thou be filled, and with his glory covered, and with his power armed againſt every temptation, all which he will make thee heir of with him, as thou mindeſt to be faithfull, and hearkens to his movings, to obey them in all things, who thereby will lead thee his Way by which he obtained all this Glory and Power, and this Inheritance from the Father; in which way thou
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:59822:5"/>wilt find a croſs to all thy own wayes, and to the worlds ſpirit in all things, which will be eaſie if thou keep thy eye ſingle to him who is ſet before thee therein, his glory, and the gaining thereof; but if thou look back into the World, thou lookeſt into temptation without him, and there the ſpirit of the World preſents thee with loſs, and not with gain, ſetting before thee what thou muſt forgo, with all the hardſhips and impoſſibilities that may be, but no power to bear it; but keeping the eye to him, thou haſt alwayes power and peace before thee in thy Way, the Hope thereof will be as an Anchor, and the Faith a Shield, and the Love will give thee Life to undergo all the trials for his ſake, bearing his Croſs daily, which muſt part thee and thy ſins, and crucifie the worldly ſpirit with the luſt thereof, and kill all that wars againſt thy Soul, and keeps thee from thy inheritance; wherefore it is called, <hi>The great Power of God unto Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as thou becomes faithfull thereto, thou wilt feel the fruit of that holy One ſpringing in thee, moving to be brought forth, in thee towards God and man, thy Faith will grow, and prayers with ſtrong cries to the Father; as the Spirit ſees thy wants, thy love will ſpring and move in thee, and bring forth towards God and man upon all occaſions, which if thou willingly ſerve in its ſmalleſt motion, it will increaſe, but if thou quench it in its mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings, and refuſe to bring it forth, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And it is the like of gentleneſs, meekneſs, patience, and all other vertues which are of a ſpringing and ſpreading nature, where they are not quenched, but ſuffered to come forth to his praiſe in his will and time, who is the Begetter thereof, and to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of his own Seed, and croſs to the World: And if thou be faithfull daily to offer up the body as a Sacrifice, to bring forth his Image, Name, and Power before his Enemies, then what he moves thee to bring forth ſhall be thy inheritance, and will daily encreaſe with uſing; but if thou wilt not give up for his Name ſame, but would hold the treaſure, and eſcape the reproach, then will it be taken from thee, and given to him who will yield the Lord of the Vineyard his Fruit in due ſeaſon; for that which the Father freely begets, he will have freely brought forth, that the ſhining thereof in the dark World may praiſe him; what a glory it is to

            <p>There is a way in which the barren becomes fruitful, and a little is more ſerviceable to God then he that hath great <hi>Riches</hi> for himſelf; you that ſees your wants are nigh it, and the lowly mind will ſooneſt follow it; and for the honeſt hearted it is prepared, who ſeeks to ſerve God and not your ſelves. If you takes heed to your own wayes, and make nothing in your minds, you muſt not create that which muſt ſtand before God, for he will be ſerved with his own begettings in you. Take heed therefore you make nothing to your ſelves, nor murther that which he freely begets, but let your minds be always heavenly, waiting with patience in that which lets you ſee your wants therewith that your hearts may be open alwayes upward towards God the Father of every good gift; and you being hid in the heavenly mind from that nature which compaſſeth the Earth in its compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>benſions, and would compaſs Heaven alſo, and waiting in a croſs to that mind, as you come into the patient ſtilneſs, you
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:59822:6"/>will feel the begettings of the Father moving in you to be brought forth, to which you muſt become Servants, ſetting aſide all ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty, and that which is haſty, and whatever is your own, or hath an end to your ſelves, and in the pure mind behold what way this moves its appearance againſt the worldly ſpirit, that with your whole hearts and might you may bring it forth in its own image, without reaſoning or conſulting with any thing of your own, or any thing of this world, for this ariſeth in a contrary nature to that which is one with the world, bears another image and fruit, and hath another glory in its appearance, in which the Father alone is glorified, even in this his Son of his own free be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting; and herein is the Father glorified, that he be brougt forth with his fruits into the world, who thereby is known how far he is above and contrary to the wordly ſpirit, both in the ground, root, and off-ſpring.</p>
            <p>And whoſoever will give up themſelves to ſerve him herein by his increaſe, ſhall become rich towards God, and increaſe in ſtrength daily againſt the World, and by bringing forth, and by his beauty in holineſs, ſhall become glorious and beloved in the ſight of the Father, whoſe image and begetting they bear, wherein they ſhall become Heirs of the eternal glory.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But if you look into the earthly mind, there the worldly ſpirit meets you with his counſel, and conſulting and reaſoning therewith, you take counſel in the night, from which the Counſel of God is hid, his work, the end and glory thereof, and inſtead of that you will be preſented with the pleaſure and glory of this world, which ſtands in viſible things, and is pleaſing to the viſible eye and ſenſes, which glory the god of this world ſees into, and leads into, in which his wiſdom and knowledge ſtands, which cannot enter into the inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble glory and treaſure. And in this ſpirit that knows not God, nor his works, nor ſeeks his own glory, will you meet with the thief and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer, ſons of dankneſs, who will perſwads you ſtrongly to murther the pure motion, and not to bring it forth, or elſe ſo to bring it forth as that the image thereof may be ſo marr'd, as not to bear its clear and perfect teſtimony againſt the worlds kingdom, power and glory, and this you cannot avoid if you look back into his counſel, and conſult with your own reaſonings, wherein ariſes thoughts, cares and pleaſures out of the World, which sumbers the mind, choaks the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:59822:6"/>ſeed, and kills the holy child, and covers the Pearl with earthly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and luſts, which continually hardens the heart, and ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens the will againſt the Innocent, and ſo puts the juſt to death in the womb, for want of bringing forth in its time, and according to its motion, which when you have rejected, you cannot beget again of your ſelves, nor in your own wils, though you may procure the likeneſs from another ſpirit in that nature which reſiſts the truth, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rups the mind, and brings forth in its own will, as ſome have done who having diſobeyed the ſtill motion of the meek ſpirit, and looking for high things God hath given them up to a lofty ſpirit, and ſtrong workings in a contrary nature, who now have a power wherewith to reſiſt that which firſt begot them out of the World, and a moving ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit which draws towards the World again, which being got into the place of God (as God) makes them believe that their return is of the ſame ſpirit that called them out, to which they yielding the ſame obedience, thenceforth without fear, becomes the ſame they were, if not ſeven fold worſe, without all hope of recovery: and this diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience becomes as witchcrafts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore in the fear of God watch with all diligence, hearken in the ſimplicity of your hearts, and take heed that you ſlip not any time of hearings, nor prove falſe in your conception or bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth, but that both calling and election may be made ſure to you, not only by being in the knowledge of it, but alſo by bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it forth, that it may be your own for ever: for that which you bring forth is your inheritance, and none can take it from you, but you have power therein againſt all contrary ſpirits, which whileſt it is but in the motion, will ſtrongly tempt, and ſeek the life thereof to ſtifle: but being brought forth, it is before you, and only ſo it is put on as a Breſt-plate, and becomes a defence, which being begot, and not brought forth, it withers and becomes as dry bones in the womb.</p>
            <p>Therefore, as you muſt give your minds wholly to hearken, ſo muſt you give your ſtrength wholly to obey: and when you feel the pure to move in you, with your whole ſtrength ſerve it, and bring it forth, give up your bodies a Sacrifice for his ſake whom you have not ſeen, that his Life may be made manifeſt in your mortal fleſh, and through you to the World, that he may be ſeen in his brigheneſs to you that love him, and before his Enemies, then
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:59822:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>is the body for the Lord, and not for Fornication: But if you reſt in the knowledge of this myſtery, and bring not forth to Life, with that knowledge you commit Fornication, and teach others to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Fornication alſo; this knowledge in the diſobedient mind be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the mother of Harlots, and Fornications of the Earth, with which the Kings of the Earth are deceived, but none ever joyned to God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For it is not the hearing of the Truth that purifies the Soul, but the obedience of Truth which makes the veſſel fit for the Maſters uſe, who in his uſing, and its obedience makes it a veſſel of honour, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifies his Son therein, in a body prepared to do the Fathers Will in the World, whereby the Father is glorified in the Son, in whom he ſhines forth in the clear Image, as the Father begets him again in you, and you in him, which was in him before the World was, of his own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and good will, which as you receive again by Faith and Obedience, you will be changed into the ſame Image and Nature, and to delight only therein, being born of the ſame Spirit; as he that is born of the Fleſh-delights in the things of the Fleſh.</hi>
